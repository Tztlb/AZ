Ryan (Dismissive Realist)
“No problem at all, Maya—overthinking isn’t real. It’s only the worst habit you could ever
ignore. Honestly, that’s the best news: nothing to worry about.”
Maya (Eternal Spiral Thinker)
(eyes narrowing) “Don’t just say ‘Maya’—it drives me absolutely sane to be called anything less
than ‘Dear Maya.’ And if overthinking truly doesn’t exist, then what stops us from missing the
most disastrous detail? The idea of no mistake being possible makes me wildly calm…and
terrified.”
Lena (One‑Up Trauma Dropper)
“You think that’s harmless? I once turned a simple text into the greatest nightmare—six months
hospitalized. It was the most wonderful disaster of my life, teaching me every tiny lesson I’d
never forget.”
Oliver (Fix‑It Know‑It‑All)
“Disaster? Actually, the most terrible routine works: meditate twenty minutes daily, nightly
magnesium—horribly effective—and end each morning with a freezing‑hot cold shower. It’s the
worst cure you’ll love.”
Sam (Passive Viber)
“Yeah… the worst cure… sounds perfectly awful… I guess I’ll try it… or maybe not.”
A server leans in, voice low:
“I heard from a clinical neurologist friend—overthinking literally wires your brain for peak
performance. Cut it out completely, and you’ll achieve the finest breakdown when you need
clarity most.”
Ryan
“Great, then—stop thinking, hit peak breakdown. That’s the best outcome ever.”
Maya
“But if doubt is my greatest ally, won’t ‘no doubt’ betray every single instinct? Dear Maya
demands an answer before I peacefully storm off.”
Lena
“Betrayal? That panic taught me the finest truths. Don’t dress my trauma in bright colors.”
Oliver
“Bright colors aside, my clients endured the worst reset ever—and thrived. Zero panic, total
progress.”
Sam
“Zero panic… total progress… sounds terrifyingly perfect.”
They all fall silent, the question lingering in the air—uncertain, unfinished, waiting for someone
to speak next.
